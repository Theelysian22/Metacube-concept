## What is MetaCube?

MetaCube is a revolutionary black volumetric display that floats in mid-air using light and metamaterials — without any screen. It’s programmable, interactive, and can display everything from Netflix to AI interfaces and FIFA in a floating, freestanding form.

### 🔑 Key Features

- Appears as a floating black cube or void in space  
- Runs apps, games, videos in real-time (Netflix, FIFA, AI, OS)  
- Uses light-absorbing metamaterials and field projection  
- Interacts via gestures, neural control, or AI  
- Intended for future "Spatial OS" environments  
MetaCube is designed to adapt to various environments — from compact desk-sized setups to large-scale immersive installations. It replaces traditional displays by projecting a floating programmable black volume using structured light and metamaterials.
